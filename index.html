                <h3>High School Second Semester Junior</h3>
                <p>With one large project under my belt I decided to make the largest bowl I could possibly work on with the tools in our schools shop. I really wanted to challenge myself and make the most intricate thing I could think of. </p>

                <h3>Fruit Bowl</h3>
                <p>This fruit bowl or platter is constructed of purely hardwood and glue. The piece measures 22" in diameter and took over 50 hours to complete. The inspiration came from anchient atriums and colluseums. </p>

                <h3>2018 Summer: Pre-College</h3>
                <p>During the summer after my junior year of high school I enrolled in the California College of the Arts Industrial Design Pre-College program to diversify my portfolio and make sure that ID was the major I wished to persue.  </p>

                <h3>Cardboard Lounge Chair</h3>
                <p>This large piece is my take on the renound cardboard chair project, where designers are challenged to create a structural chair from limited matierals. I created a prototype chair and then a full size chair with designed ergonomic contouring and interesting form.</p>

                <h3>Senior Year</h3>
                <p>In my final year of high school I wanted to take calsses in subjects I suspected I would not persue in the future. So for one semester I took a jewlery class and in another an algorithmic design class.  </p>

                <h3>Fractal Lamp</h3>
                <p>I made this lamp with a laser cutter and some thoughtful CAD work. The final piece was constructed from medium density fiberboard and was decorated with a fractal I coded in grasshopper.</p>
