          <h3>Before High School</h3>
          <p>Prior to my time in high school I spent most of my time making visual art or basic scultpure. This interest in spacial relationships and desire to make physical objects led me to persure a highs school experience where I could follow this passion. </p>

          <h3>High School - Freshman </h3>
          <p>My freshman year of high school was also relatively uneventful in terms of my creative development. I spent most of my time persuing successs in my academic classes as the arts cirriculum was not very open to personal interpretation</p>
